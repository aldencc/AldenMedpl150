<h1>Image 2</h1>

<img src="hallway.jpeg" width="80%">
  
  <p>I decided to shoot this because it's a part of Hunter I didn't even know existed until very recently and I wanted to infuse maybe a little of my weariness of this new place into the image itself. I decided to use the crack in the door for a framing object for the image overall both to make the photo feel claustrophobic and give make the viewer confused of space and where they are and what they're looking like because on top of it being through doors I think that hallway has a very interesting design and feel all its own.</p>
