<h1>Alden Crane</h1>
<p>I am Alden Crane and I hesitate to call myself an artist as a definitive statement. I come from the belief that if you have the motivation and the idea to make anything that that in that time of creation is you being an artist, so by that everyone at one point or another is an artist as they are human and at that point it stops being a description of any specific person or career. I digress the literal definition of what an “artist” means little when the only thing that I think truly matters in art is its meaning to the artist in both how I believe that even if something you make everyone else hates and it only means something to you as the artist; And I believe that that art is infinitely more important and beneficial than “art” made as a product that may on one hand be made out of mass appeal on the other devoid of care and passion of the artist making it. It is for this reason I take such inspiration from the passion of artists like David Lynch and Sam Lake while both in different mediums of video games are so unabashedly themselves in their art and that clarity of an artist making what they want to make and saying what they want to say in the truest way they can. While I completely understand the reasons for art for profit and its necessity in survival for so many, I think it's also important to use those means in order to make whatever that greater art is for yourself that you truly want to make in your heart.</p>
