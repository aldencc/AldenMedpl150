<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Image 1</h2>

  <img src="ladder.jpeg" width="80%">
  
  <p>This picture I had a hard time chosing because technically its the second of 2 pictures I took that went together but I found this one the more stand out of the two in a way that stands alone. This one stands out the most because of its composition, I love the way the roof/sky cuts through the image directly in the middle. It almost makes them feel like 2 images stitched together with those proverbial stitches being the ladder that takes you out of this deep darkness to this gloomy blue while still feeling somber is blue none the less, the color of sadness but also the color of hope.</p>
